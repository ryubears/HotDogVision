# HotDogVision
Custom hotdog classifier model built using a convolutional neural network.

To run the notebook, extract the data from https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog/data (data 1) and https://www.kaggle.com/c/hotdogornot/data (data 2). For data 2, you would have to run a python script that iterates through the hotdot and non-hotdog pictures and places them in the right folder structure.
